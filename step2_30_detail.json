                "description": "The image shows a histogram plot with 10 bars of varying heights. Each bar represents a frequency count of data points falling within a specific range. The x-axis is labeled with values from 0.0 to 1.0, incremented by 0.2. The y-axis is labeled with values from 0 to 16, incremented by 2. The bars are colored in a gradient from dark red to yellow, indicating the frequency count of each bin. A colorbar is displayed on the right side of the plot, showing a gradient from 0.0 to 1.0, corresponding to the color map applied to the bars.",
                "technical_details": "The histogram is created using the `plt.hist()` function from matplotlib. The data used to generate the histogram is a random array of 100 values between 0 and 1. The color of each bar corresponds to the frequency count of the data points in that bin, with a color map applied to the bars. The colorbar is created using the `plt.colorbar()` function, with a ScalarMappable object that maps the frequency counts to the color map."

                "description": "The image shows a simple matplotlib plot with three subplots arranged in a mosaic pattern. The main subplot is labeled 'A' and occupies the left half of the plot. To the right of 'A', there are two smaller subplots, 'B' and 'C', arranged vertically. 'B' is at the top right, and 'C' is directly below 'B'. The plot has a grid with x and y axes labeled from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating the relative positions of the subplots within the overall plot area.",
                "technical_details": "The image demonstrates the intended layout of the subplots when using subplot_mosaic with a nested mosaic and width_ratios. The width_ratios parameter is set to [2, 1], which should make the 'A' subplot twice as wide as the combined width of 'B' and 'C'. However, the error message indicates that this configuration is not supported due to the nested mosaic structure."
