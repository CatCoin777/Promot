The legend values are incorrect, as the body mass values are in the order of 1E6. The issue also reproduces if you create the plot using the `scatterplot` function instead of `Plot`. The issue stems from not using the offset value of the `ScalarFormatter` used to generate the tick labels. The code of `ScalarFormatter` suggests that the issue also depends on the following rcParam settings: `mpl.rcParams['axes.formatter.useoffset']` and `mpl.rcParams['axes.formatter.offset_threshold']`. However, I did not test it. The offset value can be safely retrieved from all formatters and based on that it can be used to create the legend title and/or labels."
