This image is necessary for documenting the specific issue, as it provides a concrete example of the problem and its cause. The image also includes relevant technical details such as the Matplotlib version, Python version, and backend, which are important for understanding the context of the issue. The image contributes to issue documentation by highlighting the specific error and the necessary steps to reproduce it, which is crucial for debugging and resolving the issue. The image is important for developers to understand the problem and take appropriate actions to fix it."
