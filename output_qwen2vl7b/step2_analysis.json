The issue reported is related to the output of this diagram when using Python type hints, specifically with the use of `None` as a default value for a parameter in a class constructor. The current behavior is that pyreverse does not read Python type hints and does not include them in the UML diagram. The expected behavior is that the UML diagram should include the type hint information, such as `a : String`, to provide a more accurate representation of the class structure. The inclusion of this image is necessary to demonstrate the issue and to show the difference between the current and expected behavior. The technical value of this image lies in its ability to visually represent the class structure and to highlight the missing type hint information. This image is important for documentation as it provides a clear and concise way to understand the issue and to communicate it to others. Developers should focus on the missing type hint information and the need for pyreverse to read Python type hints in order to resolve the issue."

The plot shows the calibration curve for three different binning strategies: 10 log-space bins, 10 bins, and 100 bins. The 10 log-space bins result in a smooth curve, while the 10 and 100 bins result in a noisy curve. The noisy curve is due to the fact that there are many data points in some bins and few, if any, in others. This issue is particularly problematic when using a gradient boosting model, where the probabilities are very uncalibrated and most of the predictions are close to 0. The user workaround provided in the feature request allows for arbitrary bin spacing, which would help to resolve this issue. The image is necessary for documenting the issue because it visually demonstrates the problem and helps to illustrate the need for a solution. The technical value of the image lies in its ability to show the impact of different binning strategies on the calibration curve.

The code attempts to compute the Taylor series expansion of the cosine function and then substitute the cosine function back into the series expansion. However, it encounters a TypeError: ConditionSet not iterable from Order.subs. This image is necessary for documenting the issue because it provides the exact code snippet and the error message, which helps in understanding the problem and identifying the root cause. The image also reveals that the issue is related to the `ConditionSet` object, which is used to represent a set of conditions in SymPy. The error message indicates that the `ConditionSet` object does not support iteration, which is likely due to a type mismatch or an incorrect data structure. This technical detail is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the issue. The image also shows the execution time of the code snippet, which is helpful for understanding the performance implications of the issue. Overall, this image provides a comprehensive view of the issue and its technical details, which are essential for documenting and resolving the problem."

The second image shows the same plot with some additional lines and markers, but the parameters set by `set_sketch_params()` are still not visible. This image demonstrates that the parameters set by `set_sketch_params()` are ignored by the PGF backend and do not have any influence in the resulting pgf or pdf file.
