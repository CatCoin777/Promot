The issue is that pyreverse does not read Python type hints, as defined by PEP 484, and this results in the attribute 'a' being displayed as 'None' in the UML diagram instead of the expected type hint. The expected behavior is that the attribute 'a' should be displayed with the type hint 'String' in the UML diagram, as it is defined in the code example provided.
