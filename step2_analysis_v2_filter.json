It is directly connected to the reported issue, which is a regression in the dashes due to a specific commit. The image captures the expected outcome of the plotting code, which is to show a line with a linear trend. The inclusion of this image is necessary to demonstrate what the code should produce when functioning correctly. \n\nTechnically, the image reveals that the plotting code is intended to create a simple linear plot. The absence of any dashes on the line suggests that the issue might be related to the line style (ls) parameter being set incorrectly or not being recognized by the Matplotlib backend. This insight is crucial for troubleshooting, as it indicates that the problem lies in how the line style is being interpreted or applied. \n\nDocumentation-wise, this image provides a clear visual reference for developers to compare against when reviewing the issue. It highlights the expected behavior of the plotting code, making it easier to identify where the regression occurred and what needs to be fixed. Developers should focus on the line style parameter and how it interacts with the Matplotlib backend to resolve the issue."
